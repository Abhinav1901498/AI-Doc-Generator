# AI-Doc-Generator
The AI Document Generator is an intelligent system that combines Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing to automatically create, analyze, and store professional documents. It simplifies the document creation process by allowing users to generate written content, reports, and summaries directly from text, images, or webcam input.

The project integrates multiple AI features into one platform:

 AI Text Generation: Uses Google Gemini to create essays, reports, blogs, poems, and summaries based on user topics.

 OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Extracts text from scanned or captured images using Tesseract OCR.

 Object Detection: Identifies objects in images through YOLOv5, generating descriptive visual reports.

 Emotion Detection: Analyzes human emotions from images using the FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) model and creates emotion-based mood documents.

 Webcam Capture: Captures real-time images for text or object detection.

 Database Integration: Stores all generated content in MongoDB, including metadata such as creation date, topic, emotion, and file type.

 File Conversion: Converts generated documents into multiple formats like PDF, TXT, RTF, HTML, and Markdown using Pandoc.

This project demonstrates how multiple AI technologies—Vision AI, Generative AI, and Machine Learning—can be integrated into one efficient and user-friendly application for real-world automation.
